I have always been a fan of video games since SEGA 👾, and I was determined to get into game development 🎮. When I further got into mobile game development, I understood why there was a closing credit after a very well-created game that included a battalion of developers 👩🏾‍💻👩🏼‍💻.

I made baby steps by creating Mobile Applications 📱. Then, I further learnt Backend development 🗄️ to aid me in building Full-Stack Applications for fun. After that, Cloud Computing ☁️ came along the way when I needed to deploy my Ideas. Finally, I became interested in Security 🛡️ when my first WordPress site was hacked.

When I am not playing, watching or debating about <a href="https://www.arsenal.com/" aria-label="External Link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><u>Football ⚽</u></a>, I'm listening to music(<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2juoSjrfYJTDGobdoUoxpE" aria-label="External Link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><u>Jazz 🎷</u></a> & <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4vK2TN6Pum5obvUPGtcmLi" aria-label="External Link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><u>Highlife 🐚</u></a>) or with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cci__uk/?hl=en" aria-label="External Link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><u>CCI UK ♾️</u></a>. I am a life-long learner 👴🏿. The moment I find something intriguing, I find the reason behind it to learn and master it 🥋.

I am presently an Edu Buddy/Cloud mentor 👨‍🏫 with <a href="https://codeyourfuture.io/" aria-label="External Link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><u>CodeYourFuture</u></a> in London. You should join us 🤝!
